# Asia Am 191A Spring Project (Tentative Title)

## What social problem is being addressed? Who is being empowered by your mapplication?
By focusing on LGBTQ+ identifying UCLA undergraduate students, our mapplication will provide specific, salient information related to this marginalized community that will inform public and private institutions about this groupâ€™s sexual health and behaviors for future social change.

## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
Potential technical and ethical problems with this project include obtaining enough responses to be statistically significant, obtaining a representative sample of the LGBTQ+ identifying undergraduate UCLA community, and accounting for individuals who are questioning their sexuality but do not yet feel comfortable identifying as part of the LGBTQ+ community.
