        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>PrEP, otherwise known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a medicine which aids to combat contracting HIV through sex and injection drug use. 
            With its high success rate and an effort to  promote safe sexual health for fellow LGBTQ+ Bruins attending UCLA, our group project focused on 
            sharing their experiences, opinions, and own access to PrEP in order to amplify their unique individual experience at UCLA and in the new 
            life-saving contraceptive PrEP. In doing so, we hope it can raise awareness and be used as a platform for affordable and 
            accessible safer sexual health with medicine such as PrEP for LGBTQ+ students.

        <h2>Locations of UCLA Student's Access to PrEP</h2>
        <p>To learn and visualize the current accessibility to PrEP for students was, we chose to map the responses
            shared by LGBTQ+ UCLA undergraduate students about the location of their current access to PrEP if they do take it
            based on our community survey, looking at whether their current access was on or off campus.

        <h2>Learn More About our Project</h2>
        <p>This project was conducted by a group of UCLA undergraduate students, UCLGay, who all shared a grave interest 
            in improving conditions for the LGBTQ+ undergraduate population at UCLA, for the course Asian American Studies: GIS Change and Web Development, taught by Albert S. Kochaphum. 
            While reflecting and recognizing a lack of known resources for this population at UCLA in the access for PrEP, our group then focused on finding ways to empower this population of student's 
            needs and voices.</p>
            
        <p>We focused on the difficult conversation surrounding PrEP, which is the accessibility of it to people of marginalized communities. In particular, we wanted to look at its accessibility for UCLA undergraduates who identify
            as part of the LGBTQ+ community, comprising itself of multiple intersectionalities between race, gender identity, and sexual orientation that affect PrEP's accessibility to these populations. We applied GIS mapping to visualize 
            where this community was currently accessing PrEP for themselves such as off or on campus, and asked their thoughts about UCLA's current provided access to PrEP for students. 
            </p>

        <p>With a drive and focus on appropriate and adequate allyship, accessibility in web design, and being descriptive while prescriptive, our project aims to be a source of advocacy, 
            a platform to voice this community's historically silenced opinions and stories, and ultimately spread awareness about accessibility to PrEP for LGBTQ+ UCLA students.
